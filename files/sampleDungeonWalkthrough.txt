Upon entering the dungeon, the player should head north to The Wall in order to
pick up the BastardSword (to have something to fight with). There is a VoidMage
in this room, and from here you can either "tradeWith" or "fight" him. If you
fight him, know that the sword 25 damage and the VoidMage has 100 health, it'll
take a minimum of 4 hits to kill him. If you tradeWith him, all he has to offer
is VoidEssence - which isn't necessary to win. From The Wall, you should head
south 6 times to "sitOn" the IronThrone, activating the dungeon's win
condition. There are 2 other NPCs wandering the dungeon that you can fight or
trade with if you see them - they shuffle into randoms rooms every 10 "moves"
(moveCommands) the player makes.
