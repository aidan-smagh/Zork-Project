Combat -- There are NPCs in the rooms that will move to a random room. You
have the choice to wage war against these vermin even though they will never
attack you first. The NPCs have inventories and you will be able to pick up 
whatever they drop upon their deaths. You will be prompted to select an item
to use in your battles, but make sure that is an item that does damage. 

You can test the combat feature in zorkplus.zork (in this same directory) 
by going to a room with items and making sure one of the ones in your
inventory
